Main objective: get familiar with developing web-based applications and CRUD operations.
Suppose you have a list of items. The items here could be the products of an online store, or the
employees that work for an organization. Each item should have at least 4 attributes: ID, name,
description, and image.
Implement the following operations:
• Browse the list of items.
• Sort the list by item ID, or by item name.
• Search an item by a keyword or by ID.
• Add a new item to the list (assuming the ID is auto generated).
• Select an item to edit (assuming you can edit any attribute except for the ID).
• Remove an item.
All operations are web-based.
You are free to select the programming language and the database management system.

NOTE: the program should display an actual picture for image, but it displays an icon and word for me instead.

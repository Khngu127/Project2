This the section for step by step instructions on how to perform the program

NOTE:
mydb.sql should be imported into your MySQL database
you will need to install the necessary imports through Pycharm

These are the following pip commands I used:

pip install Flask
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pip install Pillow  # For image processing (PIL fork)

//IF YOU DONT HAVE MYSQLCLIENT

pip install mysqlclient

if done correctly the program should look exactly like step4

the Add item button and Edit button will bring you to their respective menus, delete will delete the row while clicking on ID or NAME will list
it in ascending or descending order
